# LANMan (Local Area Network Manager)

### Supervisor: Professor Nathan Clarke

## Project Vision:

The vision of my project is help address the lack of awareness of devices in Local Area Networks (LAN) as well as the importance of updates to devices and provide a rough guidance on what the risks are by introducing unpatched / unconfigured devices to the network. 

 

The ideal consumer of this product would be inexperienced people (both home users and micro and small enterprises) who would just like to have an overview on their network which would include patching of systems and a reminder on each new network device if they have been configured to remove default passwords and so forth. 

 

Security within the network you are connected to is for everyone. Both the owner of the network and people who connect to it. The problem with it is that people with less technical backgrounds are often left overwhelmed with the number of tools and options to pick from.  

 

LANMan (Local Area Network Manager) will be a “Security Tool” which can be installed onto a Raspberry Pi or equivalent device. It will offer an interface for a user to be able to look at what is currently on the network and, where an agent (Windows & Linux devices) is installed, see the patching status of those devices, whether the device is up-to-date or if it is missing key updates. It will not be similar in fashion to other available tools such as “Nagios” which offers service monitoring / device monitoring, nor will it be like software such as “AdGuard” or “PiHole” which offer ad-blocking services.
